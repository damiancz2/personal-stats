# Personal Stats

Personal Stats is an application that allows you to ask yourself sets of questions on a regular basis.
With that you can gather data about yourself over time or track progress over your goals.
The app is designed to be flexible so the use cases are not limited to that.
You define the questions that you ask, what kind of answer do you expect
and how often you want to answer them.
Then the data gathered can be used for visualization or finding correlations between answers to different questions (future goal).

Example questions:
* How many hours did you sleep?
* How many minutes of exercise did you get today?
* Did you practice guitar today?
* How are you feeling at the moment?
